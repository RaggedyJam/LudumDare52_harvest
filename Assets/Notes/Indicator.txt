A suggested made to me by people for the ludum dare
is to add a indicator to find plants.

I also found another game that used this when you
got close to a target this game had you eliminating
targets untill none where left in contrast to my
game where you just keep finding more and more.

If I change my game to be a count down instead it
may make me focus on doing some level design which
is a weak point of mine with making games that I 
should practice at least a little.

Also if my game now has an indicator I either need
to keep track of a list of spawned objects or I now
would only need to have one at a time till the
player no longer needs it (this would mean changing
my project might open up windows for new mechanics)
